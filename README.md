Quality-of-life improvements for New York Times crosswords and puzzles

## Features
* Keyboard shortcuts for crosswords/acrostics
    * Hold Shift for pencil mode
    * Press grave (\`) to pause
* Adds links to all puzzles in the navbar for easy access
* Spelling Bee: Letter shading to assist with pangrams
* SET: Clearer distinction selected vs. unselected tiles when hovering
* Nitpicky removal of style annoyances
    * Removes title text on crossword board
    * Allows you to collapse all the days on the stats page bar graph
    * Replace the 'how to solve' link on the homepage with a much smaller one
    * Remove ugly "FREE" badges from puzzle links on the homepage

## To-do list
* Known issues to be fixed
    * If you switch tabs from a crossword while holding Shift, the pencil mode will stay on until you manually turn it off.
    * If NYT ever makes a crossword with the grave character in it, there is no easy way to type it. (Workaround: Type \` somewhere else, copy it, enter Rebus mode, and paste it.)
* Create an options page
    * Allow user to disable features they don't like
* Allow rebinding of keyboard shortcuts
* If you right-click a letter in Spelling Bee, it will repeat endlessly as long as the right-click context menu is open. This is NYT's bug, not mine, but I'd like to fix it all the same.
